## TODO: It would be simpler to use our container, but it is based on distroless - which is great because it's slim, but it does not have any shell support
## Can use busybox to copy necessary functionality in, but could not fix depednency on `dev/stdin` for the health_check
## Use bullseye instead of buster because we need glibc >2.29 available, bullseye is released since 10.09.2022
