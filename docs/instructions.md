# ItchySats

ItchySats enables peer-2-peer CFD trading on Bitcoin using DLCs (discreet log contracts). No account needed, no trusted third-party - just you and your keys.

This is beta software. We test it on testnet and mainnet, but there are no guarantees that it will always behave as expected.
Please be mindful with how much money you trust the application with.

CFDs trading is inherently risky, be sure to read up on it before using this application.

That said: This is pretty awesome, go nuts!

1. Fund the ItchySats wallet
2. Open a position
